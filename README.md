# Genisse
**Genisse** stands for **Gen**eric **I**nteractive **S**cript **S**keleton used as an **E**xample.  

It is a useless but smart base to build your interactive bash scripts. To get help please use: 
> ./genisse.bash -h 

## Why Genisse?
I learnt a lot building a complex script to analyze a bunch of application log files. I wanted to share with my team as a tutorial to bash.

The idea is to give simple ways:
- to display a lit of results
- to choose a item in the list and perform an action

Now I use this script as a base for new scripts.

## Principles
A command can have arguments.
With no arguments, the command display the list of possible results.
With an argument, the command is performed on the corresponding item.
